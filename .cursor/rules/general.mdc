- I prefer C# code that is readable and well-commented.
- Use PascalCase for class names and method names.
- Use camelCase for variables and parameters.
- Always include null checks and proper error handling.
- Avoid magic numbers â€” use constants or serialized fields.
- Provide brief summaries for methods and classes when possible.
- Suggest unit tests using Unity Test Framework when appropriate.
